    "# Beginner: Cutout of the TESS FFIs using Astrocut and Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows the user how to use the MAST programmatic interface to create a cutout of the small section of the TESS FFIs. For this example we will determine the RA and Dec for TOI 109.01, which is on TIC 29344935. We then perform a query to determine which sectors contain this RA and Dec, peform a cutout of the FFI time series, open the resulting target pixel files, and plot the first image of each file with the WCS overlayed on the image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows the users how to do the following: use astroquery.catalogs to query the TIC, use the python requests module to query the available sectors, and use python requests to obtain an FFI cutout with tesscut.\n",
